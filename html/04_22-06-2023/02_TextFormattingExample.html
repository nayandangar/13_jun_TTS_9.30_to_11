            <b>HTML</b> is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other
            material
            into
            <ins><em>visible
                    or audible web pages</em></ins>. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined
            in
            the
            browser, and
            these
            characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the
            text
            elements
            are mentioned in the <mark>1988</mark> ISO technical report TR <mark>9537</mark> Techniques for using
            <big>SGML</big>,
            which describes
            the features
            of early
            text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early <mark>1960s</mark>
            for
            the CTSS
            (Compatible
            Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by
            typesetters to
            manually format documents.<code>However, the SGML concept of generalized markup</code> is based on elements
            (nested
            annotated ranges
            with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been
            progressively moved
            in this direction with CSS<sup><a href="https://dummyjson.com/">[10]</a></sup>.
